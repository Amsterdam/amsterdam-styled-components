# Hidden

A (headless) component that you can wrap around other components to decide if they should render according to a specific mediaQuery. This component, as it is headless, doesn't render an html element, only the children or nothing.
This component uses the [useMatchMedia](https://github.com/Amsterdam/amsterdam-styled-components/tree/main/packages/asc-ui/src/utils/hooks/useMatchMedia.ts).
